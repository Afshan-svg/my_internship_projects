# my_internship_projects
During my internship I covered HTML, CSS, and ReactJS fundamentals with tools like Tailwind and MaterialUI. Projects like Cyber Creative and Sochi Beach websites focused on responsive design and cross-platform compatibility, emphasizing code reuse and user experience consistency, with thorough mobile and desktop testing.
